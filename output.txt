 Kindly please approve my financial aid, so that I can become a great asset to my family by helping my younger siblings in their
 financial and educational status run smoothly without any worries when I get recruited by a prominent company.
My career goal is to become a software developer, where the significant task of a software developer is to have a basic idea of 
all trending technologies across the world. And in meanwhile while I was reading blogs about python found interesting and since
 it has a wide range of companies approaching to implement python has been around for almost two decades. 
now, it is constantly growing, and is one of the most popular programming languages. 
It not only benefits web and mobile app development but is also quite helpful for mathematicians, data analysts, scientists, and 
researchers but also students and the probability of recruiting employees with python has high and since the competition for 
jobs in India becoming more tougher, we are expected to get aware of all important and reigning technologies in future. 
Applying loan for a with even minimum interest is very tough for me because, our family is already suffering from shortage of 
money and debts to clear and I cannot add another boulder on my family's expenses.
